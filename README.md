# Learning Southern Quechua

Yet another Quechua-from-English guide ~ Spoken by over 8 million people in South America and around the world, the Quechuan languages emerged from the cradle of civilization along the coast of Peru and Andean mountains. A former lingua-franca of the Inca Empire, this is a language that sounds phonetically beautiful, is truly unique, and isn't too difficult to learn.

### About this page

This page is a collection of free study materials I've collected while learning. As [Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages) is a language family that features ambiguity, it's worth noting that the materials here aim to fall under the [**Southern Quechua**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Quechua) language (**II-C**). Specifically, [Cusco-Collao Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cusco%E2%80%93Collao_Quechua) with slight preference towards the [Cuzco-Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuzco_Quechua_language) dialect, and adhearing to the [Standard Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_alphabet) orthography and [spelling system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_and_Aymaran_spelling_shift).
