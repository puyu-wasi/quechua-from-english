# Learning Southern Quechua
(as an English speaker)

### About this page

This page is a collection of study materials I've collected while studying. As [Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechuan_languages) is a language family that features ambiguity, it's worth noting that the materials here aim to fall under the **[Southern Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Quechua)** language, with general preference towards the [Cuzco-Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuzco_Quechua_language) dialect and [Standard Quechua](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quechua_alphabet) orthography.

# Reasons to learn
* Completely regular verb congigations
* Three vowel system
* Familiar latin alphabet IS the writing system
* Spiritual language
* Evolved entirely sperately from probably anything else you know
* Lots of shared vocab, with Spanish and even English
* Sounds beautiful
* You can make a difference
* Wolfram-saphire theory?
