# Starting Vocabulary & Grammar (for me)

### Purpose of this page

Notes on words contained here
* Mostly / entirely normalized to Peru 1985 standard (as in runasimi.de)
* This is my own subjective list, of words needed to replace "regular internal dialog"
* The intention is to force these words in to memory strongly
    * Instant recall
    * Very regular practice
    * This will provide a foundation for more learning later
